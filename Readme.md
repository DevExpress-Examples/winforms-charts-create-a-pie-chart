# How to create a Pie chart


The following example demonstrates how to create a [Pie](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2978/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/2d-series-views/pie-and-donut-series-views/pie-chart) chart at runtime.

Note that this series view type is associated with the [Simple Diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5906/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/simple-diagram?p=netframework) type, and you should cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.Diagram?p=netframework) object to this type, in order to access its specific options.
